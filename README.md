## Overview
This project encompasses three dashboards designed to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and store metrics using data from the provided datasets. Each dashboard leverages Excel for data processing and visualization to derive actionable insights for business optimization. Below is a detailed description of each dashboard, including key findings and recommendations, accompanied by screenshots of the dashboards as referenced in the provided files.

## Key Features
- **Customer Demographics Analysis**: Utilizes pivot tables and DATE formulas in Excel to segment customers by age and gender, revealing high-value segments like the 35-44 age group, which drives 25% higher spending.
- **Profitability and Revenue Tracking**: Employs SUMIF and AVERAGEIF functions with line and bar charts to visualize profit trends, weekday/weekend revenue splits, and monthly target variances, highlighting seasonal peaks in Q4.
- **Product Performance Insights**: Leverages conditional formatting and pivot charts to identify top-performing products (e.g., "Attorney Mist" with $78,081.85 profit margin) and high-return categories like Energy Drinks (9% return rate).
- **Store Performance Evaluation**: Uses VLOOKUP and pivot tables to compare store revenue against targets, identifying overperformers like Store 3 (10% above target) and underperformers like Store 4 (15% below in Q4).

## Data
- **Customers Table (customers_table.csv)**: Contains customer details (ID, name, gender, location, date of birth) used for demographic analysis, such as gender profit distribution and age-based spending patterns.
